                <p>Vendor may amend this Agreement at any time by notice provided to you in accordance with this Agreement, and your continued use of any affected Solution at any point at least 30 days after the notice date will constitute your acceptance of the amendment of this Agreement. Vendor may require that you accept the amended Agreement in order to continue using any affected Solution you have previously acquired. If you decline to accept the amended Agreement, Vendor may terminate your use of such affected Solution, in which case you may obtain a refund for the portion of the subscription fee you have paid for the unexpired or unused portion of the Subscription Period by following the instructions found <a href="refund-policy.html" class="link-primary">here</a>.</p>

11.3. ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. YOU WILL NOT SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.</p>
				<p id="arbitration-agreement-4"> 11.4. If you and Vendor do not resolve any Dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act (“<i>FAA</i>”), 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and the substantive laws of the State of New York (without regard to choice of laws principles). Except as provided in Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement-5" class="link-primary">11.5</a> below, you are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in litigation as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right to judicial review under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.</p>
				<p id="arbitration-agreement-5">
11.5. The arbitration requirement of this Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a> is subject to the following exceptions:</p>

<p>11.5.1. You may litigate any Dispute in small claims court, in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside, if the Dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. If you initiate a claim in small claims court, you are responsible for all court costs and fees.</p>

<p>11.5.2. All Disputes concerning any alleged misappropriation of your or Vendor’s intellectual property will be resolved in court.</p>

<p>11.5.3. If you are a consumer and live in the European Union, Norway, Iceland or Lichtenstein, you may be entitled to address your Dispute through an internet platform for online dispute resolution established by the European Commission (the “<i>ODR Platform</i>”). The ODR Platform is intended to facilitate out-of-court resolutions relating to online purchases of goods and services between consumers and traders based in the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein. You will find the ODR Platform by following this link: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/" target="_blank" class="link-primary">http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>.</p>
				<p id="arbitration-agreement-6">11.6. Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “<i>AAA</i>”) in accordance with the AAA’s “Consumer Arbitration Rules” effective September 1, 2014, including the “Costs of Arbitration (Including AAA Administrative Fees)” effective September 1, 2014 (collectively, the “<i>Consumer Procedures</i>”) and will be subject to the following:</p>

<p>11.6.1. The Consumer Procedures provide for certain fees, specifically allocating some to the consumer (you) and others to the business (Vendor). If your claim is US$75,000 or less, Vendor will pay all of those specified fees and costs, including those allocated to the consumer. Vendor does not agree to bear any other costs. If your claim is more than US$75,000, the Consumer Procedures will govern payment.</p>

<p>11.6.2. Except as provided in below, the AAA’s Consumer Procedures will be applied to any Dispute between the parties. However, pursuant to Consumer Arbitration Rule R-1(e), a party may raise the proper application of the Consumer Arbitration Rules to an arbitrator for a final decision. This Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Consumer Procedures. You will commence arbitration only in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside. The arbitration proceedings will be conducted by conference call. However, if the proceedings are conducted pursuant to the AAA Consumer Procedures, the arbitrator(s) will have the discretionary authority to require a face-to-face hearing upon the request of a party.</p>

<p>11.6.3. You and the Vendor agree that the use of the AAA to administer arbitration is not integral to the parties’ agreement to arbitrate Disputes. If the AAA will not or cannot conduct an arbitration, you and Vendor will negotiate in good faith to agree on a sole arbitrator who will resolve the Dispute as provided in the Consumer Procedures. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint an arbitrator, who will follow the AAA’s Consumer Procedures.</p>

<p>11.6.4. If one or more parts of this Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a> are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then, and only in that circumstance, those parts will be severed and the Dispute will be resolved subject to all remaining parts of this Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a> and all other provisions of this Agreement. If such severance results in all or some parts of a Dispute proceeding in a court of law, exclusive jurisdiction for any such court proceeding will be the courts sitting in the county of New York, New York, U.S. For purposes of any such court proceeding, you consent to, and will not challenge, the New York, New York courts’ personal jurisdiction over you, and you further waive objection based upon improper venue or forum non conveniens and will not seek transfer to another district or jurisdiction.</p>
				<p id="arbitration-agreement-7">11.7. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a>, if you acquired a Solution for other than personal or household use, the arbitration proceedings, including the payment of costs, will be administered in accordance with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “<i>Commercial Procedures</i>”). The Commercial Procedures are appropriately applied to any Dispute between the parties, and you will not advocate otherwise in any proceeding. However, this Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Commercial Procedures.</p>

You acknowledge and agree that the Associate, or you acting on the Associate’s direction may alter, delete or corrupt software or data on your equipment, change equipment, software or network settings, or otherwise interfere with the proper operation of your equipment, software or network.</p>

<p>(c) You acknowledge and agree that the Associate may have access to any information stored on your Device. Associates are trained not to access more information than necessary to resolve the issues for which you are requesting the Associate’s support.

<p>13.12.6. Although Vendor may not charge you separately for bandwidth in connection with your use of the Avast Secure Gateway, Vendor and the relevant Vendor Partner incur significant bandwidth costs in providing of the Avast Secure Gateway to you. Accordingly, a material increase in your bandwidth consumption in connection with your use of the Avast Secure Gateway will significantly affect and disrupt the business operations of Vendor and the Vendor Partner. You acknowledge and agree that, in circumstances where your bandwidth consumption in connection with your use of the Avast Secure Gateway materially exceeds the number of DNS Transactions, or DNS Transactions per Seat, specified by the Applicable Conditions, Vendor or the Vendor Partner may notify you, in which case you must negotiate in good faith with Vendor: (i) on a bandwidth reduction plan; and/or (ii) to increase the pricing for of the Avast Secure Gateway for the remainder of the Subscription Term.

On termination or expiration of the Subscription Period, the Transaction Logs shall be deleted by Vendor Group and Vendor Partners pursuant to the standard retention cycle of Vendor Group and Vendor Partners, or earlier as you may request in writing.</p>
				<p id="special-terms-13">13.13. Certain HMA Solutions</p>

<p>13.13.1. Virtual Private Network. Unless otherwise provided by the Applicable Conditions, your subscription to the HMA Virtual Private Network product (the “<i>HMA VPN</i>”) authorizes you to create no more than 5 simultaneous connections in respect of each HMA VPN subscription. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if you exceed the number of simultaneous connections authorized for your HMA VPN subscription, Vendor may at any time without any prior notice to you, suspend or disable your access to, and/or use of, the HMA VPN. If you wish to increase the authorized number of simultaneous connections for your HMA VPN subscription, please contact us at <a href="mailto:sales@hidemyass.com" class="link-primary">sales@hidemyass.com</a>.</p>

<p>13.13.2. Web Proxy. The HMA web proxy service (“<i>Web Proxy</i>”) is a free Solution that does not require you to register your details with Vendor. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for, and Vendor Group and Vendor Partners accept no liability to you or any third party for: (a) your access, viewing or use of, or the contents of (including any offensive or objectionable content), any third party website accessed or viewed while using Web Proxy; (b) your compliance with the terms of use applicable to any third party website you access, visit or use while using the Web Proxy; and (c) any claim, loss or damage arising from any content that you create, make available, transmit or display while using Web Proxy, including any claim, loss or damage suffered or incurred by Vendor Group or Vendor Partners.</p>
				<p id="special-terms-14">13.14. Virtual Private Networks. Several countries prohibit or restrict the use of virtual private networks (“<i>VPNs</i>”), and some have instituted technological measures to prevent VPNs from working. As a result, Vendor’s VPN Solutions (including the HMA VPN) are subject to territorial restrictions that may change from time to time. You can find further information <a href="vpn-territory.html" class="link-primary">here</a>.</p>
				
<p id="special-terms-15">13.15. Appliance. Vendor may provide you with a dongle or other appliance (the “<i>Appliance</i>”) as a part of your Solution, in which case the additional provisions set forth in this Section <a href="#special-terms-15" class="link-primary">13.15</a> will apply:</p>

<p>13.15.1. The limited warranty period established by Section <a href="#limited-warranty-1" class="link-primary">6.1</a> is extended for the Appliance to 1 year from the date of purchase (the “<i>Appliance Warranty Period</i>”).</p>

<p>13.15.2. You must notify Vendor promptly if the Appliance is or becomes defective. If you notify Vendor of the defect during the Appliance Warranty Period and Vendor is unable to remedy the defect remotely, Vendor at its option and expense within 5business days will either: (a) replace the Appliance with a new or refurbished unit of the Appliance, in which case the warranty established by Section <a href="limited-warranty-1.html" class="link-primary">6.1</a> will apply for the remainder of the Appliance Warranty Period applicable to the original unit of the Appliance; or (b) terminate your subscription and refund any unearned subscription fees you have previously paid. If the Appliance fails following the end of the Appliance Warranty Period, or if it fails because of misuse, tampering, interference, abuse, casualty, loss or theft, Vendor may charge you its standard price for the replacement unit of the Appliance. Vendor in its sole discretion may replace the Appliance with a new or different appliance that will also be subject to this Agreement (including Section <a href="#special-terms-15" class="link-primary">13.15</a>).</p>
				<p id="special-terms-16">13.16. Mobile Threat Intelligence Platform</p>

<p id="special-terms-16.1">13.16.1. As used in this Section <a href="#special-terms-16" class="link-primary">13.16</a>:</p>

<p>(a) “<i>Content</i>” means any content, materials, products and services that you may access on or through the MTIP, including Vendor Content, Your Content and information you may exchange with other MTIP users.</p>

<p>(b) “<i>MTIP</i>” means the Mobile Threat Intelligence Platform made available by Avast.</p>

<p>(c) “<i>Threat Sample</i>” means any code, feature, routine or device that contains, describes or demonstrates any element of Malicious Code.</p>

<p>(d) “<i>Vendor Content</i>” means all Content that members of the Vendor Group upload, publish, display or make available to others by using the MTIP, and all Content that is published, displayed, distributed or made available by other parties using the MTIP, but excluding Your Content and Threat Samples.</p>

<p>(e) “<i>Your Content</i>” means all Content (excluding any Threat Samples), materials, products and services that you upload, publish, display, distribute or make available to others by using the MTIP.</p>

<p>13.16.2. Vendor Content, as between you and the Vendor Group, is the property of the members of the Vendor Group. Members of the Vendor Group, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, grant you a limited, non-exclusive license to use and access Vendor Content as made available to you on the MTIP solely in connection with your use of the MTIP.</p>

<p>13.16.3. The availability of any Content on the MTIP does not amount to an endorsement or verification of such content by any member of the Vendor Group. Members of the Vendor Group make no warranties or representations regarding the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any Content made available on the MTIP. Members of the Vendor Group are not providing any advice or recommendations to you by making Content available on the MTIP (including in respect of Vendor Content) and, accordingly, you must form your own judgments and decisions based upon your own due diligence and investigations, and must not place any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any Content made available on the MTIP.</p>

<p>13.16.4. By uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making available Your Content on the MTIP, you grant members of the Vendor Group a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid up, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple tiers), license to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, upload, publish, transmit, store, display, distribute, make available to others, and otherwise use Your Content in connection with the operation or use of the MTIP or the promotion, advertising or marketing of the MTIP, in any and all media or distribution methods or modes of making the MTIP or Content available to others (now known or later developed). You agree that this license includes the right for members of the Vendor Group to make Your Content available to Vendor Partners who collaborate with members of the Vendor Group for the uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making available Your Content through other media or distribution methods or modes of making the MTIP or Content available to others. This license also includes the right for other users of the MTIP to use and modify Your Content. You understand that we may modify, adapt, or create derivative works from Your Content in order to upload, publish, display, distribute or make it available over computer networks, devices, service providers, and in various media. We may also remove or refuse to publish Your Content on the MTIP, in whole or part, at any time in our sole discretion.</p>

<p>13.16.5. By uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making available Your Content on the MTIP, you represent, warrant and undertake to each member of the Vendor Group that: (a) you have the ownership rights, or you have obtained all necessary rights licenses or permissions from any relevant parties, to use Your Content and to grant members of the Vendor Group all necessary rights, licenses and permissions to use Your Content as provided for under this Agreement; and (b) that uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making available Your Content on the MTIP will not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party or member of the Vendor Group, violate the privacy or other personal rights of others, or violate applicable law. You accept full responsibility for avoiding infringement of the intellectual property, violation of the privacy or other personal rights of others or violation of applicable law in connection with Your Content. You agree to pay all royalties, fees, and any other monies owed to any person by reason of you uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making available Your Content on the MTIP or members of the Vendor Group or Vendor Partners exercising any of the rights, licenses and permissions you have granted under this Section <a href="#special-terms-16" class="link-primary">13.16</a>.</p>

<p>13.16.6. No member of the Vendor Group makes any representation, warranty or undertaking regarding Threat Samples, and the Vendor Group disclaims any warranty (whether express or implied) that the reproduction, distribution or use of any Threat Sample does not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party, violate the privacy or other personal rights of others, or violate applicable law. If you use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, upload, publish, transmit, store, display, distribute, make available to others, or otherwise use any Threat Sample, you assume all associated risks, and irrevocably waive all rights to bring a claim against any member of the Vendor Group in connection with such Threat Sample.</p>

<p>13.16.7. For the avoidance of doubt, Sections <a href="#ownership" class="link-primary">4</a>, <a href="#restrictions-1.7" class="link-primary">5.1.7</a>, <a href="#restrictions-1.11" class="link-primary">5.1.11</a> and <a href="#restrictions-3" class="link-primary">5.3</a> (“<i>Pertinent Sections</i>”) shall be applicable to Your Content and your use of the MTIP (including uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making Your Content available on the MTIP). This Section <a href="#special-terms-16" class="link-primary">13.16</a> and the Pertinent Sections, to the greatest extent practicable, will be construed to be consistent with each other, but in the event of a conflict they will govern in the following order of precedence: (i) this Section <a href="#special-terms-16" class="link-primary">13.16</a>; and (ii) the Pertinent Sections.</p>
